"""ADR-117 P4 — Pure-Python client layer.

This sub-package is the **client-facing** half of `wifi-densepose`:
end users who only want to *consume* live RuView telemetry (rather than
running DSP locally) get a tight, opt-in client extra:

```
pip install "wifi-densepose[client]"
```

The runtime install footprint stays small for users who only need the
compiled PyO3 surface: `websockets` and `paho-mqtt` are declared as the
`[client]` extra in `pyproject.toml` and are NOT pulled in by the
default install.

## Modules

- `ws` — `SensingClient`: asyncio WebSocket client for the
  sensing-server `/ws/sensing` endpoint (ADR-115 §1)
- `mqtt` — `RuViewMqttClient`: paho-mqtt v2 wrapper for
  `ruview/<node>/raw/+` + `homeassistant/+/wifi_densepose_<node>/+/+`
  topics (ADR-115 §3)
- `primitives` — `SemanticPrimitiveListener`: typed view over the
  10 HA-MIND semantic primitives (ADR-115 §3.12)
- `ha` — `HABlueprintHelper`: parses MQTT-discovery payloads, helps
  users introspect what entities a node is publishing

No PyO3 here — this module is pure Python so it loads without the
compiled extension (useful for users who only want the client surface
and not the DSP pipeline).
