# ADR-117 §7.2 — v1.99.0 tombstone.
#
# This module is part of the `wifi-densepose==1.99.0` PyPI release.
# Its ONLY job is to raise ImportError on import so any project that
# upgraded from the legacy 1.x line gets a clear migration error
# rather than a silent broken import.
#
# The real package lives at `wifi-densepose>=2.0.0` (built by the
# PyO3+maturin pipeline in `python/`).
