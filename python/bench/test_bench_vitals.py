"""ADR-117 hardening sweep — Benchmarks for the P3 vitals hot paths.

Targets the ESP32 production rate: 100 Hz × 56 subcarriers, which is
what `BreathingExtractor.esp32_default()` is tuned for. The bench
asserts the *per-extract* cost is comfortably below 10 ms — at 100 Hz
that's the entire frame budget, so anything above 10 ms means the
Python binding would be the bottleneck instead of the radio.

Run with:
    pytest python/bench/ --benchmark-only

The benchmarks are skipped by default (`addopts` in pyproject.toml
doesn't include them) — they live in a sibling `bench/` directory
so the main test run stays fast.
